<p>
He was always a queer old codger&mdash;my
Great Uncle Abner.  I had
never laid eyes on him myself, but
his eccentricities were tradition to
me, and when I thought of him at all, it was
as a half-cracked old fellow living alone in a
shack, on a sandy key, somewhere off the coast
of Florida.  Naturally one doesn't get close-range
impressions of uncles of this sort, especially
if one's own life runs in very different channels,
and if one has enough money to get along on,
and one's "sandy-key-uncle" is not thought to
have much of this world's goods.
</p>

<p>
On the morning that Uncle Abner's letter
came I had gone downstairs to breakfast feeling
rather beastly.  I saw the large legal-looking
envelope beside my plate, but, hardly having an
appetite for eggs and coffee, I naturally felt no
enthusiasm for mail.
</p>

<p>
Drinking my coffee, I observed that the
envelope was bulky&mdash;the sort of envelope that
might contain specifications for a breach of
promise suit.  After a few sips of coffee I found
the energy to open it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
Dear Sir:&mdash;You will find enclosed herewith
a sealed letter, which we are forwarding
to you in accordance with instructions
of your late uncle, Abner Barker, before
his death, which occurred, as you are of
course aware, at Lone Palm Key, Florida,
December 20th.  Our instructions were to
forward the enclosed letter to you one
month after your uncle's death, and to
inform you that another letter&mdash;an exact
duplicate in every way of this one&mdash;has been
sent simultaneously to the only other
surviving relative of Abner Barker, namely:
Graham Stewart, of Brooklyn, N.Y.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Trusting that we may hear from you in
case we may be of any service, we remain,
</p>

<p class="letter">
  Yours very truly,<br>
  Blackmar, Mathews & Blackmar.<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>
The letter enclosed by Blackmar, Mathews
&amp; Blackmar was in a dirty, home-made, yellow
envelope, sealed with five large blobs of red
wax.  It read as follows:
</p>

<p><p class="letter"></p>

<p class="letter">
Nephew Allen Spencer:&mdash;I send you a
chart with this letter.  If you are a young
man of any energy or ability&mdash;which I
very much doubt&mdash;it will be worth your
while to investigate this chart, and put it to
whatever use it may suggest.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I shall send another chart exactly like
this one to Graham Stewart, of Brooklyn,
who is the only other relative to survive me.
This letter will be held by my attorneys
until one month after the day of my death
and will then be forwarded to you.  I
shall watch your use of it with interest,
from the spirit-land.  I understand that
you are a frivolous, idle youth, who are not
likely to seize your opportunities.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  Your uncle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abner Barker.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I unfolded the chart.  It was a queer looking
thing, carefully drawn upon yellow wrapping
paper.  It conjured up recollections of
Stevenson's "Treasure Island" and pictures of
savage-looking buccaneers, and desolate, sandy
beaches.  There was a square marked "<i>House</i>,"
with a dotted line running through the
middle of it.  Then there were innumerable
other spots, and dots, and lines signified
variously.  The word "<i>spring</i>" was written at one
point; "<i>Lone Palm Tree</i>" at another.  In the
centre of a circle, to which led dotted lines, my
eyes were arrested by the words: "<i>Treasure
buried here</i>."
</p>

<p>
I had imagined Uncle Abner a prosaic man;
now it seemed I was wrong.  He was a dreamer
on his sandy key; he lived with the shades of
corsairs and saw ghostly galleons riding at
anchor off his strip of coast.  Poor old Uncle
Abner!  There was something grimly grotesque
in the situation.  One does not associate charts
and buried treasure with a light noon breakfast
in a clubhouse on Fifth Avenue.
</p>

<p>
I think it was a flurry of cold rain upon the
window which first turned my thoughts seriously
toward Lone Palm Key.  New York is a
beastly place in a January thaw.  I imagined
the sun shining warmly at Palm Beach, girls in
pretty summer dresses and men in tennis flannels.
Then again I heard the swish of the rain against
the window, and looking out, saw a cab horse
slip and fall upon the asphalt.
</p>

<p>
"Buried treasure or no buried treasure," I
said to myself, "Uncle Abner has given me a
good idea.  I'll go to Florida this very afternoon."
</p>

<p>
A line from Blackmar, Mathews &amp; Blackmar's
letter caught my eye:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
&mdash;&mdash;The only other surviving relative of
Abner Barker, namely Graham Stewart,
of Brooklyn, N.Y.&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Who was Graham Stewart?  I had never
heard of him before.  Most probably a relative
on the other side of Uncle Abner's family.  Had
he received his letter?  Perhaps even now he
was hurrying South ahead of me!
</p>

<p>
I had Henry look up trains at once and sent
word upstairs to have my trunk and bag packed
with nice, summery things for Florida.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, as I drove to the 23rd Street
Ferry, and saw the cold rain streaking down
the carriage windows, I felt genuinely grateful
to old Uncle Abner for bequeathing me this
excellent excuse for getting out of town.
</p>

<p>
After all, there was something like sport in
going down to Florida to look for treasure.
The idea appealed to me more and more.
I felt that I was in a race with Graham Stewart.
As the Seaboard Florida Limited drew out of
the Pennsylvania Terminal, and started on its
run toward warmth, sunshine and Uncle
Abner's treasure&mdash;<i>perhaps</i> Uncle Abner's
treasure&mdash;I settled myself and began a close
inspection of my fellow-travellers.  If Graham
Stewart was on the train I wished to pick him
out.  And something told me he <i>was</i> on the
train.  I made a mental inventory of my
fellow-passengers.  Was <i>he</i> Graham&mdash;that slim
youth in section twelve?  He had pale hair and
wore glasses, and looked at though he <i>might</i>
live in Brooklyn.
</p>

<p>
But no; he was calm.  Graham would be
nervous.
</p>

<p>
The keen-faced old man in section five was
a likelier specimen; men with gray beards and
smooth shaven upper lips are usually seekers for
treasure, either buried or unburied.  I leaned
forward and tried to get a glimpse of the letter
he was reading, but as I looked he tucked it
away in an inside vest pocket.  I would hunt
him up later and ply him with talk of "Treasure
Island," old coins and things of that sort.

</p>

<p>
By all odds the most interesting passenger
was the girl in section seven&mdash;the girl with the
big, blue eyes and long dark fringe for lashes.
Every time I looked at her my interest in the
buried treasure dwindled.  I wished that she sat
opposite instead of several sections off, for I
have a rather useful set of plans that often work,
when girls sit opposite in Pullman Cars.  But
alas!  How seldom the pretty girls <i>do</i> sit
opposite!  I always draw a fat man in a skull cap,
or a wheezy old lady who uses peppermint!
There always is a pretty girl, but she is
invariably placed far from where I sit.  On this
particular occasion she was so pretty&mdash;so very
pretty&mdash;that I grew morbid on the subject.  What a
dull, stupid thing a bachelor life can be!  I
have no doubt I stared at her, as I reflected
thus, for presently she brought me to with a
frosty little look.  Pulling myself together
hastily I went into the combination car to drink
and smoke and think it over&mdash;no, not the girl,
the buried treasure!
</p>

<p>
The old man I had picked out for Graham
Stewart came in not long after, and sitting near
me, lit a very bad cigar.  We drifted into
conversation and, quite casually, I managed to
speak of "Treasure Island."
</p>

<p>
He said he had never heard of it&mdash;or
Stevenson.
</p>

<p>
I told him of the book; of the map in the
front of it, that showed where the gold was
hidden.  Then I professed great interest in old
coins.
</p>

<p>
My efforts were rewarded by the strange
side-long glance he gave me and when, shortly
after, I began to speak of pirates he left me
suddenly.  Later, I noticed the porter and the
Pullman Car conductor regarding me with interest.
When, before the trip was over, I gained the
porter's confidence (at reasonable cost) I
learned that the old man with the white whiskers
had told them I was crazy&mdash;that I talked
wildly of most extraordinary things.  Evidently
the old boy was not Uncle Abner's heir,
after all.
</p>

<p>
That evening after dinner I took out the
letter and the map and studied them with care.
The more I did so the more ridiculous they
seemed.  There is something indescribably
grotesque in starting off to hunt for buried
treasure in an electric lighted Limited.  I felt
that I ought to be dressed in Oriental togs with
a red handkerchief about my head and a pair of
flint-lock pistols in my belt.  When the girl with
the long lashes passed and glanced in my direction
with cold, unseeing eyes, I felt more ridiculous
than ever.  How could a man hunt gold,
I asked myself, with girls like that abroad?
</p>

<p>
And immediately two impulses seized me.
</p>

<p>
"Graham Stewart and the treasure be
hanged!" I resolved, crumpling Uncle Abner's
chart in my hand.  "I'll go back in the
Pullman and have a look at the young lady&mdash;even
if I can't talk with her."
</p>

<p>
But as I walked through the train I smoothed
out the map and laid it away in my wallet.
When convention and the girl frown, I might
as well have something, I thought, to fall
back on.
</p>

<p>
She was sitting with some magazines in her
lap, gazing vacantly into the night.  I passed
without apparently noticing her and sat dejectedly
in my section.  Man's sadness will awaken
a woman's interest where nothing else will, you
know.  And before long the corners of my
eyes caught a suspicion of sympathy in her
regard, as if she read trouble in the countenance
I was furrowing for her, and was sorry.
</p>

<p>
Without seeming to look in her direction I
sighed the manliest sigh I could muster.  I
seemed to feel her sympathy deepen to pity and
then&mdash;crash!  Her magazines slid to the floor.
I sprang to collect them for her.  But confound
these women prigs!&mdash;that was all.  She thanked
me haughtily, rang for the porter and ordered
her berth made up.
</p>

<p>
I went forward for a smoke, was drawn into
a game, and forgot about treasure and stingy,
sneaking cousins and disagreeable eye-lash girls
until late the next morning.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I did feel a good deal hurt, however, when I
went by the young person on my way to breakfast
that she didn't seem to know me from the
porter.  I cursed civilization that makes Fate
and girls cruel, and stayed away all day to
show her I didn't even think of her.  I really
did think very little.  I was canvassing the train
for a treasure-troving male relative.  I satisfied
myself he was not aboard.  But the thought of
that unapproachable young woman robbed me
somewhat of my gratification.
</p>

<p>
When we reached Palm Beach I drove directly
to the Royal Poinciana.  I rather expected
that the girl might be there, too, but I
did not catch sight of her that evening, nor of
any man that could possibly be Graham Stewart.
</p>

<p>
In the romantic surroundings of the Poinciana
the interest of my quest returned.  Down there,
the thought of buried treasure did not seem so
strange.  Before retiring I ordered a steam
launch to take me to Lone Palm Key at nine
o'clock the following morning.
</p>

<p>
It was ten when I woke up.  Hurriedly I
dressed and breakfasted, but it was noon when
I set out, first making an arrangement with the
launch's engineer to do some digging for me
when we reached the key.
</p>

<p>
All my eagerness returned as we approached
the long, low strip of land where poor old
Uncle Abner lived so many years.  A sloop,
with idly flapping sails, lay at anchor near the
little landing, telling me that in all probability
my remote connection, Graham Stewart, had
reached the key before me.
</p>

<p>
I felt genuine excitement mingled with chagrin
as we drew near.  How long had he been
there?  Had he found the treasure?  How
would he receive me?
</p>

<p>
My captain knew the captain of the "Jennie
May," and hailed him as we came alongside.
</p>

<p>
"What you doin' 'way out here, Cap'n Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Got a lady," Captain Bill replied.  "She's
over there beyond that sand dune, havin' a
picnic all to herself.  Didn't say she was
<i>expectin'</i> no one."  He eyed me disapprovingly
as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
So it was not Graham Stewart after all!
That was a relief, though I was sorry anyone
was there.  I should feel foolish digging for
Uncle Abner's treasure if a gull watched me,
let alone a girl!
</p>

<p>
Leaving the engineer to anchor and follow
later with the shovels we had brought, I jumped
ashore and hastened up the low sand hill, above
the top of which I saw the lone palm tree from
which the key took its name.  From the top I
could see old Uncle Abner's shack perhaps a
quarter of a mile away.  Then my eye was
arrested by a white figure near the deserted little
house.  It was the figure of a woman, and
horrors! she was digging in the sand.  I hastened
on and presently came up with her.  Her back
was turned.  She did not see me as I stood for
a moment, amused, watching her pathetic efforts
with a funny little shovel, such as is used for
putting coals in kitchen ranges.  She was
working in a desultory way that plainly showed
discouragement.
</p>

<p>
"Can I help?" I said to her at last.
</p>

<p>
With a little cry she dropped her shovel and
turned toward me.  It was my turn to be
startled.  She was the girl of the Seaboard
Florida Limited&mdash;the girl with the long lashes!
</p>

<p>
We stood there staring at each other for a
moment.  She was belligerent, resentful; but I
saw at once that she remembered me.
</p>

<p>
"I got here first!" she cried, "it's mine!"
</p>

<p>
I looked about at the pathetic little holes she
had been digging.
</p>

<p>
"What's yours?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"You know!" she exclaimed; "you know
well enough.  It's the treasure!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "Uncle Abner invited me,
too."
</p>

<p>
"But I got here first!" she repeated vehemently.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to have made much of
your time," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
She stooped and picked up her little shovel.
"I don't need any help," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Another thing," said I.  "I am not sure
that you have any right to be digging here at
all; the lawyer's letter said the only other
person beside myself who knew about the treasure
was a man named Graham Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"A man named Graham Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
I drew the letter from my pocket and showed
her.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't say a <i>man</i>," she explained; "see,
it only says '<i>namely</i> Graham Stewart.'"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said I, "Graham Stewart is
a man's name.  That's plain enough.  And I
don't know whether I ought to stand 'round
and let you rob him this way."
</p>

<p>
"This way!" she asked, pointing at her little
diggings.
</p>

<p>
"No, not precisely that way," I said, laughing.
"You'll have to rob him worse than that
or I don't believe he'll notice it."
</p>

<p>
"Set your mind at rest," she snapped, "I am
Graham Stewart myself!"
</p>

<p>
"But Graham is a man's name," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"Do you imagine I have been named Graham
all these years," she said, "without knowing
that!  Don't you suppose that I get advertising
circulars in every mail, addressed to <i>Mister</i>
Graham Stewart?'  Don't you suppose men's
tailors and men's haberdashers send me letters
asking for my custom?  That name has been a
life-long horror to me!  I can never make them
believe that I don't want things like razors and
Scotch Whiskey."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a very pretty name," I said
lamely.  "By the way, don't you think you received
me rather coldly, considering that we are
cousins?"
</p>

<p>
"We are <i>not</i> cousins!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," I said, "we are.  We're sort of
cousins anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to be your cousin," she
protested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I said, "don't worry about that.
Cousins can marry, especially if they are not
first cousins."
</p>

<p>
"That is impertinent!" she answered.
"Really, I can't talk to you any longer," and
she turned away as if to dig.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said, moving off a step or
two; "I am sorry, because I was just about to
show you the spot where you ought to dig.  Now
I shall find it by myself."
</p>

<p>
She gave a little start, but did not answer.
I walked over to my late uncle's house and
sitting in the shadow produced the map and
appeared to study it, while the girl went on
digging grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you have Captain Bill come up
and dig!" I called to her, as the man from my
launch appeared with the shovels.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want to let him know about the
treasure," she replied.  "I don't think it's safe."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good idea," said I, taking the
shovels from my man and telling him to return
to the boat and await me there.
</p>

<p>
Again, for a time I watched her delve in
silence.  What a pretty girl she was in her trim
duck suit!  At last I roused myself.  I had
come to Lone Palm Key to look for buried
treasure and I must begin at once.  The chart
was simple enough, now that I was on the
ground.  I had but to pace off twenty steps of
an imaginary line running through the centre of
Uncle Abner's shack, toward the lone palm
tree to point "A"; then, going to the spring a
few rods behind the house I must pace off
twenty-seven more in the direction of the palm
tree, thus establishing the point "B," upon the
map.  To find point "C," I had merely to reach
a spot equidistant between points "A" and
"B."  Here the treasure should be buried.
</p>

<p>
I rose at once and paced it out, noting as I
did so that "the only other surviving relative"
watched me with ill concealed anxiety.  When
I felt sure that I had found point "C," I threw
my coat upon the sand, seized a shovel and
began to dig.  Watching Graham (some forty
feet away) from the corner of my eye, I
presently discovered that she was coming toward
me.  I dug more vigorously than ever, affecting
not to notice her as she stood by and watched
me.  At last she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think," she ventured, "I <i>really</i> don't
think you're digging in exactly the right
place."  Her voice betrayed no certainty, however.
</p>

<p>
"I'm satisfied," I said.  "You let me dig
here and you can have all the rest of the key
for your own purposes."
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a time.  "I thought
perhaps"&mdash;she said at last, her voice quavering, "I
thought that I might help you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm a pretty good digger, thanks,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think," she said, "that our maps
may not be just alike?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>my</i> map is all right," I answered.'
</p>

<p>
After watching me for a moment more: "I'm
completely worn out," she said, "digging here
all day in the hot sun.  I think I'll have to
go."  She turned and walked a step or two, then:
</p>

<p>
"I am <i>hungry</i>, too," she added weakly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I replied.  "But you know
when I came up at first, wanting to help you,
you sent me off about my business."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered sadly, "I did, and it
was rude.  I am sorry.  But I did want that
treasure so much!"
</p>

<p>
I could resist her no longer when I saw
that there were tears in those big eyes of hers.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose," I suggested, "we make it partners?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, would you?" she exclaimed, advancing
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "if you'll do just what I tell
you to."
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" she cried, "I'll get my shovel."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, "you're not to dig; I'll do
that.  You're to go down to my launch and
eat.  I brought a lunch basket along.  How
could a hungry man find buried treasure, or a
hungry woman, either?"
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully, awfully generous," she
smiled, "but let me stay here for a while and
watch you.  I'm sure you'll find the treasure
before long.  Then we can go and eat
<i>together</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Delighted," I said.  "Your presence will
encourage me.  You're the sort of a partner to
spur a man to do his best."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," she answered, and I thought she
flushed a little.
</p>

<p>
She watched me as I dug silently and
perspiringly for the better part of half an hour.
From the treasure-hunting stories I had read I
knew exactly what sound to expect when my
spade should scrape against the casket in which
the treasure lay.  When I had reached a depth
of perhaps four feet, the work grew tiresome.
Graham stirred about uneasily.  At last she
spoke.  "Would you mind listening to a
suggestion from your partner?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
I was glad of an opportunity to stop digging.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," I answered, resting on my
shovel and looking up at her.
</p>

<p>
"How tall are you?" she asked, it seemed to
me irrelevantly.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-nine&mdash;I mean five-feet-eleven-and-a-half,"
I answered.  "How old are you?"
</p>

<p>
She gave me a cool glance.  "I don't think
my age has any bearing on the matter," she
replied with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"You asked <i>me</i> a leading question," I plead.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," she said.  "Listen; it
occurs to me that you are much taller than our
common uncle was, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He <i>was</i> common," I interrupted, "it took
a common mind to devise a miserable trick like
this!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Spencer," she said sharply, "do you
wish to hear what I have to say, or do you
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Partner," I replied contritely, "I <i>do</i>, and I
beg a thousand pardons for interrupting with my
foolish prattle."
</p>

<p>
"A fitting apology," Graham said, with what
seemed to me an effort at severity.  "What I
have been trying to suggest was this: You are
almost six feet tall.  Uncle Abner was much
shorter; also he was old.  Is it not possible that
you have paced off longer steps than he took?"
</p>

<p>
"Bully!" I cried, scrambling out of the pit
which I had digged.  "You're a partner to be
proud of!"
</p>

<p>
"I should think," she ventured, "that my
steps would give about the right measure.  I
had the map worked out all wrong; it remained
for you to solve <i>that</i> part.  But I'm awfully
glad to be of some use in the partnership."
</p>

<p>
She picked up her dainty skirts and paced
the distance off, I standing by, meanwhile, to
watch her graceful movements and her trim,
pretty feet.  The point which she ultimately
reached was several yards nearer the hut than
where my hole was dug.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat cooler from the short cessation of
my labors, I now pitched in anew.  Two feet;
three feet; three-and-a-half.  Was this to be
another false scent?  When I reached a depth
of about four feet I paused and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were big and bright.  She shook her
head as though to say: "A little farther."
</p>

<p>
Again I plunged my spade into the damp
sand.  I thrilled all through as I felt it scrape
against something hard&mdash;something metallic!
Two more shovelfuls and I had disclosed the
object.  I picked it up and held it out to
Graham.  Despite our eagerness we burst into a
gale of laughter.  It was a tomato can&mdash;quite
empty, too!
</p>

<p>
Graham's laughter stopped suddenly.  "Oh!"
she gasped, "how did it <i>get</i> there?  We are on
the right track!  Uncle Abner must have
thrown it in when he buried the treasure!"
</p>

<p>
"Great!" I cried, and then in sudden
afterthought: "unless&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Unless&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Unless," I said, "unless <i>someone else</i> has
been here before us!"
</p>

<p>
She looked into my eyes with horror at the
thought, twisting her handkerchief nervously in
her slender hands.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" she exclaimed, "you <i>do</i> think
of the most unpleasant things!"  Then, waving
her arms excitedly.  "Dig!" she cried.  "For
goodness' sake, dig!  Let's have this suspense
over with!"
</p>

<p>
I did dig and presently my industry was
rewarded by the discovery of an empty beer
bottle and a sardine can.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Abner lived high, out here on the
key," I said, holding the trophies up for her
inspection.
</p>

<p>
"Dig!  Dig!" was her only answer.
</p>

<p>
Again I got to work.  This time I suppose I
dug for three-quarters of an hour.  The hole
grew quite deep, but disclosed not so much as a
buried button.  I was very warm and very
hungry.  So I pronounced myself exhausted and
asked Graham if she wouldn't let me rest a
minute.
</p>

<p>
She said I could, so we got the captains to
bring up my lunch basket and Graham's parasol
from the boats.  Then we settled down to a
little spread on the spot.  We fastened the
parasol to a shovel handle and Graham let me sit
down beside her in the shade.  I've never had
such fun lunching as on that day.  The
sandwiches were so good and Graham and the
ginger ale so refreshing thas I was heart-broken
when there wasn't a drop or a crumb or an
excuse to sit there any longer.
</p>

<p>
So I dug again, and we were such friends by
that time that Graham kept telling me not to
work too hard and get all tired out.  After a
few moments she gave a little scream of delight
and leaning over picked a corroded coin from
the shovelful I had thrown out.  I took it from
her and rubbed its surface.  It looked like a
Mexican dollar, but I couldn't make out.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, won't you dig?" cried Graham, in an
agony of impatience.
</p>

<p>
Once more I thrust my spade into the sand.
It stopped suddenly.  This time it was neither
can nor bottle, but something which toon proved
to be a sound oak plank.  A few mad spadefuls
more and it was clear that the plank was the
cover of a heavy box, cleated, bound and hinged
with iron.
</p>

<p>
Graham stood above me gazing down with
clenched hands and dilated eyes.
</p>

<p>
The box was wedged so fast in the sand
that when I first tried to lift it I mistook the
sand's firm grip for the weight of gold within.
After some fifteen minutes' rapid work I managed
to dig it clear.  But when I lifted it my
heart sank.  It was very light!
</p>

<p>
I tossed it out of the hole as easily as I could
have tossed an empty steamer trunk.  It fell
upon its side and the cover dropped open,
revealing the interior.  I leaped from the hole and
stood beside Graham.  She was staring fixedly
at the box and as I came near her she reached
out and steadied herself by placing her hand
upon my arm.
</p>

<p>
Alas! for our dream of buried treasure!
Save for one object, the box was empty.
Rushing forward I reached in and drew that object
forth.  It was a New York newspaper, more
than a year old and wrapped within it was a
Seaboard Air Line timetable, of equally
ancient date.
</p>

<p>
These pathetic relics I placed in Graham's
hands.  She stared at them blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, partner," I said, "there's the treasure!
I make you a free gift of my half of it."
</p>

<p>
The comedy of it all burst in on me now.
The lawyer's pedantic letter.  Uncle Abner's
chart and acid note to me, my race with
Graham&mdash;Graham, whom I had mistaken
for a gray-bearded old man upon the train&mdash;my
meeting with her lovely self upon the key,
our partnership and its result.  I laughed, and
laughed, and laughed, until I nearly fell into the
pit that I had digged.  Then suddenly&mdash;quite
as suddenly as I had begun&mdash;I stopped, for I
saw Graham.  What a selfish beast a man can
be!  Could I not have foreseen that this insane
treasure hunt which was little more than sport
to me, might to Graham be a vitally important
thing?  What did I know of her circumstances?
What right had I to conclude that she&mdash;&mdash;?
Outlined sharply against the sunset sky I saw
her swaying where she stood.  There were tears
in her eyes.  I hurried to her and she leaned
against me weakly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," I said, "awfully, awfully sorry!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at me and tried to smile.  "I am
glad," she said in a quavering voice, "I am
glad that you can laugh.  I wish <i>I</i> could."
</p>

<p>
"Try!" I begged, "oh, please do try!  I
love you when you laugh&mdash;when you <i>don't</i>
laugh, too, of course&mdash;but really, Graham,
really!  I cannot bear to see you cry!"
</p>

<p>
I don't know just how I got them, but I
suddenly found that I was holding both her hands,
as I entreated.  I don't think she knew it any
more than I did when I took them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't feel badly about it!" I begged her.
"What's the use?  You must see that it's a
joke&mdash;a joke on both of us.  Either someone
got here first and took the treasure off, or Uncle
Abner thought he'd have post-mortem fun with
his surviving relatives.  You see, Graham," (I
think I may have said "Graham <i>dear</i>") "you
see the joke, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"The wicked old man!" she cried.  "It's no
joke to me.  It comes near a tragedy!  It cost
me almost everything I had to come here.  If
that's a joke, I call it a hard one!"  She was
radiant in her anger.  I was spell-bound as I watched her.
</p>

</p>

<p>
"That is tough," I exclaimed, "you have no
idea how sorry I am&mdash;honestly you haven't!"  I
think I must have squeezed her hands, for she
looked at them and drew them from mine with
a conscious little blush.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think we'd better be going to the
boats?" she ventured.  "It's after sunset."
</p>

<p>
"Since you put it as a question, no!" I
answered.  "I see no reason why we should go to
the boats.  As for the sunset, they have these
every night down here; but you and I don't
meet every day upon this key.  We ought to
make the most of it!"
</p>

<p>
"But it's all done&mdash;the treasure hunt," she
said, digging a little hole in the sand with the
toe of her white canvas shoe.
</p>

<p>
"It's <i>not</i> all done!" I cried.  "<i>Yours</i> may be
finished, but mine is just beginning and I give
you fair warning, here and now, dear Graham,"
(I said the "dear" quite plainly this time), "that
this <i>new</i> treasure hunt of mine is going to make
the old one look like the picnic party it was!"
</p>

<p>
"Really&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;" she began.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, really!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you," she faltered; "I assure you,
I don't know&mdash;I don't know what you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Graham, Graham!" I cried, "you've
been reading novels.  That's what girls always
say in novels&mdash;'I don't know what you mean.'  Yet,
they all <i>do</i> know what he means, just as
well as you know what <i>I</i> mean!"
</p>

<p>
The digging she was doing with her little
slipper interested her more than ever now.
</p>

<p>
"Graham," I continued, "whether you knew
or not, I would have told you what I meant.  I
wouldn't lose the luxury of telling you, for
worlds!  This is it: I came here to hunt for
treasure&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Buried</i> treasure?" she inquired, smiling
faintly at the toe of her white slipper.
</p>

<p>
"But we didn't find the buried treasure," I
pleaded.  "<i>You</i> found nothing but me&mdash;to help
you dig.  But <i>I</i> discovered something more than
buried treasure.  I found out where there was a
treasure&mdash;a living treasure&mdash;greater than jewels
and gold could ever be!  It's a treasure I can't
reach by digging in the sand, Graham.  It must
be given to me freely, and by you!"
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a moment, then she faced
me.
</p>

<p>
"It's because you're sorry for me," she said,
flushing; "I thank you, but I can't accept a
sacrifice like that!"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear Graham," I persisted, "it's not
because I'm sorry for you.  I'll be sorry for
you, though, if you don't take me now&mdash;sorry
to see you dogged, and pestered, and
followed everywhere, and worshipped by a man
like me, until you have to take him to avoid his
persistence!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled at me frankly.  "You have no
idea," she laughed, "how I long to say 'This is
so sudden,' but after 'I don't know what you
mean,' I am afraid to!"
</p>

<p>
"Do save yourself a lot of trouble," I
warned again, "by taking me now, Graham,
instead of waiting until I get you."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," she said, "I suppose I might
at well."
</p>

<p>
I shan't tell you what happened then, but in
my haste to do something (mind I don't say
what) I almost tumbled into Uncle Abner's
treasure pit.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
The "Jennie May" sailed home, a little later,
without the passenger she had brought to Lone
Palm Key.  Graham and I returned in the
steam launch.  When I insisted that the only
two surviving relatives of Uncle Abner be made
one at once, Graham said&mdash;you know what she
said, as well as I do.  She simply couldn't help
it.  It was:
</p>

<p>
"But, really, this is so sudden!"
